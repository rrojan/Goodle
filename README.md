# Goodle

### (WIP)

A fully responsive clone of the Google search engine that acts like a Single Page Application (meaning searches, hyperlinks, etc don't reload the page).

Original idea came from TheOdinProject's `Create a Google clone from scratch` challenge, no CSS or JS frameworks (Bootstrap, jQuery, React, etc) used.

## How to run the project locally:
1. `git clone` project into your machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
